// GROUPS SHOULD HAVE LABELS

/*
repeats:
•    loop X times
•    jr:template="" means the repeat exists no matter what (so you're not prompted about it)
•    jr:noAddRemove="true" (supposedly) means that it won't prompt whether users want more
•    jr:count specifies either a specific number or an xpath to another field
